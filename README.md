# Dotfiles

**Everybody has a bunch of them!**

## Introduction

Those files, are a collection of [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io) for my
personal use on OSX.

## Download

I do not provide *packaged* binaries for this project. The best way to
download my dotfiles is using git itself and clone the entire project.

To clone this project on your machine use this:

`$ git clone https://github.com/repejota/dotfiles.git`

## Installation

Currently I don't have any build/installation system. I'm planning to do this
but on a future release.

For now, if you want to use those files just symlink them. For example:

`ln -s .inputrc ~/.inputrc`
